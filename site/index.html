        It hasn't yet connected to the stomp server.  If this state persists for a significant length of time, check
        <ul>
            <li>that you are running a browser that supports javascript and WebSockets</li>
            <li>that you have run the development server by going into the db-updating-table directory and
                run it by running <code>npm start</code></li>
            <li>that there were no errors during the development server starting (e.g. perhaps port
                8011 was taken)</li>
            <li>that you are accessing it through that dev server, at <a href="http://localhost:8011">http://localhost:8011</a>
                and that no errors are appearing in your browsers console.</li>
